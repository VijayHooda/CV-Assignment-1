# Assignment 1 – Image Classification & Semantic Segmentation  
*Computer Vision • Spring 2025 – Vijay Hooda (2021365)*

This repository contains my solutions for two classic computer-vision tasks:

| Question | Task | Key Technologies |
|----------|------|------------------|
| **Q2**   | Multi-class image classification | PyTorch • Transfer Learning • Weights & Biases |
| **Q3**   | Pixel-wise semantic segmentation on IDD dataset | PyTorch • Custom Dataset Loader • Dice Loss |

The accompanying PDF report (`2021365_HW1.pdf`) details methodology and results.
